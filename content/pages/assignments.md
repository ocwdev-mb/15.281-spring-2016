## Motivational Speech and Self-Assessment

The first assignment of the semester requires you to create, rehearse, and execute a _5-minute_ motivational or visioning speech to a business (non-Sloan) audience and then assess your presentation in writing. In this speech you will appeal to your audience's emotions as well as to logic and facts. Visual aids are optional. While the speech may be based on a previous experience, it must be an original presentation of the material. For the Self-assessment, watch the video of your presentation and assess the strength of your argument, the clarity of your message and structure, and effectiveness of your verbal and nonverbal delivery. Write your professor and TA an email that synthesizes these observations into three areas of strength and three areas of development to focus on in your next presentation. Failure to submit this self-assessment within 72 hours of your presentation will reduce your grade for the Motivational Speech.

Prepare and deliver a _10-minute interactive persuasive presentation_. Topic may be chosen in conjunction with the 100K contest, a job-related task, a project or venture you are pursuing, or your thesis.

## Team Project: Team-Led Class

Early in the term the class will be divided up into 5 teams; each team will be responsible for teaching _one 80-minute class session_ on a specified leadership communication topic. Five leadership communication topics have been identified (1) _Data visualization;_ 2) _Social media within organizations;_ 3) _Intercultural communication;_ 4) _Dispersed / virtual teams;_ 5) _Emerging communication technologies_) and each topic will have with one accompanying thought leadership article (see last five readings in Course Reader). During designated class, teams will choose their topic in a random drawing. You and your team will research the selected topic more deeply and develop class activities to use in teaching the class. Activities could include role plays, discussion, presentations, cases, or an invited thought leader in chosen topic / discipline.
